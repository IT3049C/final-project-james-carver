# GameHub
I, James Carver will be doing this solo
## FOR PEER REVIEWER
The project is not currently in a finished state. I wanted to configure things in a way probably unusual for this course. it took a while to get set up but things are finally working, both the hub and wordle are on the live site and I will add the rest of the games later, should not take long as I have set up everything to more or less plug and play. Tests will also be addd once all four games are available to the player.
