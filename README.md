## Self Grading Guide
<!--- Update the following line with your self-grade --->
<!--- Check the Rubric on Canvas for a guideline --->

I should get **(20 )** out of 20 on feature completeness.
- Games are all fully functional with some niceties for all of them. TicTacToe and Rock Paper Scissors have the ability to play either a CPU or another player, Wordle has a hint system, memory cards compares your scores with others (see citations). All games but wordle were fully made for this project due to prior factors, so no in class help was ever given. While vanilla js was used over react for two of the games, they were the ones already made in other assignments so they were anticipated to already be done. It was unrealistic to fully complete two assignments from prior weeks during exam week and finish this project on time. As it stands all games are fully built and functional with ectra features. No corners were cut, this eas a lot of work and I am pround of the result.

I should get **(3 )** out of 8 on multiplayer integration.
- The two games that multiplater makes sense for have local multiplayer without calling the API. I wish I could build this out further but two players can play against eachother so "Developing" is an accurate assessment.

I should get **(15 )** out of 20 on Testing with Playwright.
- Playwright tests all pass on my local machine and GitHub threw up zero errors, but tests could be improved so I think 20/20 would be too high a score.

I should get **(20 )** out of 20 on Deployment
- Not much to say here, all pages load and the url is stable. I see no reason to deduct points.

I should get **(1.5 )** out of 2 on Documentation
- Readme is well written, but GitHub commits may be difficult to understand the point of by name alone.
## Self-Reflection

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
- Somehwere from 20-30 hours. I wish I used a stopwatch.

- **What do you think of this completion time?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
- It should have been shorter, especially with how I ended up doing things. Due to external factors the assignments for tic tac toe and rock paper scissors had not been finished prior to the final project. I spent a signigicant amount of time trying to do the assignments so I could have the game here appear the same, but scrapped that Idea hours in because it wold take too long for little reward. 

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
- In hindsight I would have just build the games myself the way I know how originally rather than spending so long on something I'd already gotten a 0 on. I also used generative I for bug hunting, and when it gave reccomandations I spent time looking into them and testing implementation, only to learn that the ideas presented were poor additions to this project.

- **What resources did you use?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
- perplexity.ai for quick bug hunting and giving awful advice that would have been better ignored.
- react.dev for the react portions
- MDN for general JS & CSS
- HTML was either written form memory or I just looked at previous assignments to see how I did it before.
